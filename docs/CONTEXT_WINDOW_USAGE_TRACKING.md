# Context Window Usage Tracking

How we track and display context window fill percentage for Claude Code sessions.

## Background

We show users how full their Claude Code context window is (e.g., "42% used / 200k"). The SDK's `/context` slash command stopped returning parseable output in agent-sdk 0.2.x (returns empty string, takes 30-80s), so we extract usage data directly from the streaming protocol instead.

## Source of Truth

Each `assistant` chunk from the Claude Agent SDK includes per-step `usage` data:

```json
{
  "type": "assistant",
  "message": {
    "usage": {
      "input_tokens": 3,
      "cache_creation_input_tokens": 239,
      "cache_read_input_tokens": 83066,
      "output_tokens": 42
    }
  }
}
```

The sum **`input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens`** equals the actual number of tokens in the context window for that step. The `output_tokens` field is excluded because it represents generated tokens, not context fill.

The SDK also provides `contextWindow` (e.g., 200,000) per model in `result.modelUsage`.

## Cumulative vs Per-Step Usage

The SDK has two kinds of usage data that look similar but mean very different things:

| Field | Scope | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `chunk.message.usage` (on `assistant` chunks) | **Per-step** | Context fill display |
| `result.usage` (on `result` chunk) | **Cumulative** across all steps | Not useful (zeroed out) |
| `result.modelUsage` (on `result` chunk) | **Cumulative** across all steps | Billing, cost tracking, `contextWindow` |

This distinction is critical. A session with 200k context might show `modelUsage.inputTokens = 3,100,000` because it sums every step's input across the entire session. Using that for context fill would be wildly wrong.

We track these separately in `ClaudeCodeProvider.ts`:
- **`usageData`** -- general usage tracking, gets overwritten by cumulative `result.usage` at the end of a turn
- **`lastAssistantUsage`** -- only set from `assistant` chunks, never overwritten by the result chunk. This is what we use for context fill.

## Compaction Handling

When a user runs `/compact`, the SDK produces this chunk sequence:

```
system(status: "compacting")
system(status: null)
system(init)
system(compact_boundary)    ← has compact_metadata.pre_tokens
user(compaction summary)
result
```

There is **no `assistant` message** after compaction. Without special handling, `lastAssistantUsage` would still hold the pre-compaction value (e.g., 94% full), which is now stale since the context was just compressed.

Fix: when we see `compact_boundary`, we:
1. Reset `lastAssistantUsage = undefined` so the stale value isn't used
2. Set `contextCompacted = true` on the `complete` StreamChunk
3. AIService clears `currentContext` so the UI stops showing stale data

The next real user message will produce a fresh `assistant` response with accurate post-compaction usage.

## Subagents (Task Tool)

Subagents run as **separate SDK conversations** with their own session IDs. Their `assistant` chunks are logged by `TeammateManager`, not the main streaming loop. Only the parent session's assistant messages set `lastAssistantUsage`, so subagent usage never contaminates the parent's context fill calculation.

After a subagent completes, its tool_result is added to the parent's conversation. The parent's next `assistant` message correctly reflects the enlarged context (including the subagent result).

## Data Flow

```
ClaudeCodeProvider                          AIService
─────────────────                          ─────────
assistant chunk
  → set lastAssistantUsage

compact_boundary
  → reset lastAssistantUsage
  → set receivedCompactBoundary

result chunk
  → compute lastMessageContextTokens
    from lastAssistantUsage
  → yield complete {                       → extract contextFillTokens
      contextFillTokens,                   → extract contextWindow from modelUsage
      contextCompacted,                    → if compacted: clear currentContext
      modelUsage                           → else: set currentContext = {tokens, contextWindow}
    }                                      → persist to DB + send IPC to UI
```
